#Excel Sales and Finance Analytics Project ofAtliQHardwares Codebasics

AtliQ Hardware, a leading global hardware firm specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers, is looking to increase sales and improve profit margins.

The Sales Director no longer wants to rely on reports or Excel files from various regional managers, as the vast amount of data spread across different files doesn’t easily yield valuable insights. This is where the role of a Data Analyst becomes crucial.

###My Role as a Data Analyst:
In this project, I worked on analyzing an extensive dataset containing over half a million disorganized sales records, requiring extensive effort for organization (ETL). The objective was to uncover key insights that would enable AtliQ Hardware to make data-driven decisions and monitor critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The ultimate goal was to enhance overall business performance, particularly in areas like net sales and gross margin.

###Tasks and Insights:
####Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis
I created a comprehensive report analyzing customer performance, comparing year-over-year progress and determining whether they achieved their sales targets. This insight helped AtliQ monitor customer sales patterns and decide how much discount to offer. Additionally, I generated a market performance versus target report, revealing the strong-performing regions and those in need of improvement.

####Project 2: Financial Performance Analysis

I developed detailed Profit & Loss (P&L) statements broken down by year, month, and quarter, as well as across different markets. These reports provided AtliQ with a clearer view of its financial standing, empowering them to make informed strategic decisions. The P&L insights also helped communicate with stakeholders effectively, compare AtliQ’s performance with competitors, and shape future budgeting and expenditure plans.
In addition, I created a report analyzing Gross Margin Percentage (GM%) by quarter and region.
Lastly, I prepared an in-depth report covering various aspects, including the Top 10 Performing Products, a Division-Level Report, the Top and Bottom 5 Products, and the Top 5 Countries driving sales growth.
