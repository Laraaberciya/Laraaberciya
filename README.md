# AtliQ Hardware Sales and Financial Analysis using Excel

**AtliQ Hardware**, a leading global hardware firm specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers, is aiming to boost sales and improve profit margins.

The **Sales Director** no longer wants to rely on reports or Excel files from regional managers, as the large amount of data spread across various files doesn’t easily reveal valuable insights. This is where the role of a **Data Analyst** becomes critical.

## My Role as a Data Analyst

In this project, I worked on analyzing a large dataset containing over half a million disorganized sales records, which required significant effort to organize (ETL). The goal was to uncover key insights that would allow **AtliQ Hardware** to make data-driven decisions and monitor crucial **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. The ultimate aim was to improve the company’s overall performance, particularly in net sales and gross margin.

## Tasks and Insights

### Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis

- Created a comprehensive report on **customer performance**, comparing year-over-year trends and determining whether customers were meeting their sales targets.
- Helped **AtliQ** monitor customer sales patterns and decide on appropriate discounts.
- Developed a **Market Performance vs Target** report, identifying which regions were performing well and where improvement was needed.

### Project 2: Financial Performance Analysis

- Developed detailed **Profit & Loss (P&L) reports** categorized by year, month, and quarter, as well as across different markets.
- Provided **AtliQ** with a clearer understanding of its financial position, enabling better strategic decision-making.
- The P&L insights also helped effectively communicate with stakeholders, compare performance against competitors, and guide future budgeting and expenditure plans.
- Analyzed **Gross Margin Percentage (GM%)** by quarter and region.

### Additional Reports

- Generated reports for the **Top 10 Performing Products**.
- Created a **Division-Level Report**, identifying the **Top and Bottom 5 Products**.
